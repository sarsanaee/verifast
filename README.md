VeriFast is a research prototype of a tool for modular formal verification of correctness properties of single-threaded and multithreaded C and Java programs annotated with preconditions and postconditions written in separation logic. To express rich specifications, the programmer can define inductive datatypes, primitive recursive pure functions over these datatypes, and abstract separation logic predicates. To verify these rich specifications, the programmer can write lemma functions, i.e., functions that serve only as proofs that their precondition implies their postcondition. The verifier checks that lemma functions terminate and do not have side-effects. Since neither VeriFast itself nor the underlying SMT solver need to do any significant search, verification time is predictable and low.

The VeriFast source code and binaries are released under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).

Binaries
--------

Within an hour after each push to the master branch, binary packages become available at the following URLs:

- [Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/verifast/verifast/artifacts/src/verifast-nightly.zip?branch=master)
- [Linux/x64](http://82076e0e62875f063ae8-929808a701855dfb71539d0a4342d4be.r54.cf5.rackcdn.com/verifast-nightly.tar.gz)
- [OS X](http://82076e0e62875f063ae8-929808a701855dfb71539d0a4342d4be.r54.cf5.rackcdn.com/verifast-nightly-osx.tar.gz)

These "nightly" builds are very stable and are recommended. Still, named releases are available [here](https://github.com/verifast/verifast/releases). (An archive of older named releases is [here](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~bart.jacobs/verifast/releases/).)

Simply extract the files from the archive to any location in your filesystem. All files in the archive are in a directory named `verifast-COMMIT` where `COMMIT` describes the Git commit. For example, on Linux:

    tar xzf ~/Downloads/verifast-nightly.tar.gz
    cd verifast-<TAB>  # Press Tab to autocomplete
    bin/vfide examples/java/termination/Stack.jarsrc  # Launch the VeriFast IDE with the specified example
    ./test.sh  # Run the test suite (verifies all examples)
